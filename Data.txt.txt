What is a socket ?

A socket is the one end-point of a two-way communication link between two programs running over the network.Running over the network means that the programs run on different computers, usually referred as the local and the remote computers.
However one can run the two programs on the same computer. Such communicating programs constitutes a client/server application. The server implements a dedicated logic, calledservice.  The clients connect to the server to get 
served, for example, to obtain some data or to ask for the computation of some data. Different client/server applications implement different kind of services.

To distinguish different services, a numbering convention was proposed. This convention uses integer numbers, called port numbers, to denote the services.
